# Atlas

**Atlas** is a productivity and management application designed specifically for **Amea** — inspired by the Greek Titan Atlas who carried the heavens on his shoulders. This app carries the entire Amea organization on its digital shoulders, helping the team become up to **5 times more productive** through structured hierarchy, communication, and task management.

## Why "Atlas"?

Just like the mythological Atlas, this app is built to support the entire structure of Amea, providing tools and systems that empower each member, streamline workflows, and ensure accountability.

## Features

### Hierarchical Structure
- Roles include **CEO**, **President**, **Vice President**, **Members** (divided by Chambers), and **Peasants**
- Role-based permissions and access control

### CEO Capabilities
- Promote or demote members (e.g., Vice President → President)
- Fire members
- Post notifications both inside Atlas and via email
- Notifications can contain Google Meet links accessible directly through the app
- Assign tasks with due dates, descriptions, and recipient selection
- View and manage discussions across all chambers

### Member Features
- View and edit personal profiles *(in progress)*
- Access chamber-specific chat rooms for collaboration
- Task management: view assigned tasks, update progress, and submit proof for task completion (text, image, or video)
- Notification center for important updates
- Curation system (for Chamber 1) with text editing and formatting

### Communication
- Private chat rooms for each chamber
- Global "Team Amea" chat accessible by all chambers and the CEO

### Future Plans
